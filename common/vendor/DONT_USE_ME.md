This Vendor file is exclusively for files that cannot reasonably be included via NPM.

Currently, this includes React Magic Move, which has not been updated to work with React 0.14. Some kind soul fixed it in a PR, but the repo has yet to accept the PR, so the only real way to include it is to copy the source from the PR's fork.

Periodically check if this is fixed: https://github.com/ryanflorence/react-magic-move
